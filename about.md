# BetterPauseScrollSlayer

Fed up with trying to scroll the button layer of BetterPause again and again?
This mod replaces the stupid ScrollLayer buttons design with just general buttons placed in the Pause Menu.

### Notice
The following options won't work in the original betterpause, you should set them in THIS mod for now:
*Level Edit Hack*
*Show Comments*
*Show Info*
I don't know how to fetch other mod's settings for now sry
also the eye button is removed for ~~this option cause bug for my mod~~ you can hide Pause Menu by Shady Pause.

### Future Plan
Will contact Tpdea later, perhaps this UI design will be intergrted.
